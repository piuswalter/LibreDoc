LibreDoc is an open source documentation software for your intranet. It offers the possibility to create and update documents. LibreDoc takes care of creating the necessary revisions for auditability.

## üñ•Ô∏è LibreDoc demo

The LibreDoc demo shows you all the functionalities on the latest version. Here you can test before you host your own instance.

You can find it [here](https://demo.libredoc.eu/).

## ‚öíÔ∏è Setup your own LibreDoc instance

Below is the procedure on how to set up your own LibreDoc instance.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, you need already installed software. To be specific

- PHP ([www.php.net/manual/en/install.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php))
- MySQL ([dev.mysql.com/downloads/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)) or
- MariaDB ([mariadb.org/download/](https://mariadb.org/download/))

There is also software like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/de/index.html) that already contains all the necessary components. Caution, this should only be used for testing purposes or for the instance on your own computer due to security reasons.

### Installing LibreDoc

Move all files from `src/` to the folder that can be accessed from your webserver.

Call the LibreDoc directory, you should be redirected directly to `install.php`.

Follow the installation steps as described in the LibreDoc installer. At the end of the setup you should be redirected to your LibreDoc instance and the file `install.php` should be deleted automatically. If this did not happen due to an error, be sure to delete it manually.

### Run the application

If your web server is running on your local computer, you can access your LibreDoc instance via [localhost](http://localhost/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running on HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL (or MariaDB)
